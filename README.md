A Brazilian car rental company charges an hourly rate for rentals of up to 12 hours. However, if the rental duration exceeds 12 hours, the rental will be charged on a daily basis. In addition to the lease amount, the tax amount is added to the price according to the rules of the country, which, in the case of Brazil, is 20% for amounts up to 100.00, or 15% for amounts above 100.00. Write a program that reads the lease data (car model, start and end time of the lease), as well as the hourly and daily lease amounts. The program must then generate a payment note (containing the lease amount, tax amount and total payment amount) and inform the data on the screen. See the examples.
